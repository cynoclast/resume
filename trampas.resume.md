## General Purpose Cover Letter

I am looking for a philosophically compatible job with challenging, fun problems. I specialize in development-environment-nirvana creation. I also have an astounding knack for seeing the forest despite the trees, enabling you to skip past time consuming problems to achieve your goals ahead of schedule with less work. I've worked for the Department of Defense, Healthcare, and Global Finance/Banking/High Frequency Trading and now I'm searching for something interesting.

## Professional Experience

----

**Dec 2009-April 2013**

*Citigroup, Global Markets, Equities Division (HFT)*

**Senior Programmer/Analyst**

* Created a multi-threaded pseudo-producer-consumer project that provides near real time reconciliation services and message resending capability using Java 7 filesystem notification features and serves to keep the firm in compliance with FINRA requirements.

* Designed and delivered a scripting product based entirely on common UNIX utilities from requirements to production in one week that allowed automatic reconciliation of order execution data between disparate systems automatically, complete with emailed report generation.

* Demonstrated understanding of an unstated need and created an inbound-message validation framework that handles the job so cleanly that no feature has been requested of it since its inception. All existing validation was moved to it upon its release despite being unrequested and its adoption has gone global within the company.

* Introduced mock-object testing to a legacy project, complete with concrete, highly domain-relevant examples that allow other developers to easily follow suit with creating their own mock-based tests.

* Modified the above project to build using maven within the continuous integration server, Jenkins, complete with automated static code analysis tool implementation and unit test coverage measurement that provides fast build failure notification and QA.

**Oct 2005-Dec 2009**

*Benefitfocus.com, Inc.*

**Senior Software Engineer**

* Spearheaded a company-wide plan for improving code quality, requirements, the estimation process, and automated build processes, leading to more rapid development on more readable, maintainable, reliable code.

* Introduced unit tests and EasyMock testing to a legacy codebase, providing a guide complete with relevant, concrete examples that improve code quality and unit test coverage while allowing new developers to easily follow suit.

* Worked with requirements owners to fill in gaps and clarify new requirements so development could proceed with fewer interruptions, leading to more rapid development, increased efficiency, and higher throughput.

**Fall 2004-Fall 2005**

*Department of Defense (Navy/AEGIS weapons system) / Computer Sciences Corporation / Mountain State Information Systems*

**Software Engineer**

* Customized University of Michiganâ€™s radmind project for use by the Navy/DoD, including bug fixes and performance enhancements leading to 100% improvement in system restore speed.

* Designed and implemented a simultaneous usage tracking program across Unix and OpenVMS, and Windows systems allowing the client to reduce the number of licenses to actual simultaneous users.

* Optimized usage gathering scripts, leading to a 90% reduction in the amount of time required to run.

## Education

----

*West Virginia Wesleyan College*

**Summer 2000 - Spring 2004**

Bachelor of Science, Computer Science at *West Virginia Wesleyan College*

GPA: 3.48/4.0 (Overall), 3.7 (CS Major)

## Projects and Hobbies

----

* Contributed a patch containing heap size enhancements to [the coberuta maven plugin project](http://mojo.codehaus.org/cobertura-maven-plugin/testapidocs/index.html?org/codehaus/mojo/cobertura/configuration/ConfigInstrumentationTest.html).

* Hobbies include: swimming, running, biking, miniature helicopters, redditing, writing, reading, spending time
with friends, and video games.

* I enjoy *nix hacking greatly. The fun in quickly building something fast, powerful, and that does the job itself, all from a collection of simple tools is that will run on systems older than I am. Like POSIX, but faster.
