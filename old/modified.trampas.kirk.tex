            % LiquiFiCore
            \item Demonsrated understanding of an unstated need and created an inbound-message validation framework that handles the job so cleanly that no feature has been requested of it since its inception. All existing validation was moved to it upon its release despite being unrequested.
            %Its acceptance has been demonstrated by how it was offered to other projects by management at the conclusion of its initial presentation.
            %item Repeated the above success in parallel with an enhancement framework that consumes the data feed emitted by the validation framework.

            \item Introduced mock-object testing to a legacy project, complete with concrete, highly domain-relevant examples that allow other developers to easily follow suit with creating their own mock-based tests.
            \item Modified the above project to build using maven within the continuous integration server, Jenkins, complete with automated static code analysis tool implementation and unit test coverage measurement that provides fast build failure notification and QA.
