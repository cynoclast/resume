              \item Enhanced and supported and implemented numerous feature requests to a monolithic application built on Java, JBoss, Spring, JMockit to ensure continuity of business
              \item Built a program in a spike to analyze real world user data to create a memcached cache sized to minimize costs for caching selected data for all users and added that caching ability along with a feature toggle to the monolithic application

                    \item Wrote a test harness using custom Matchers for the clearing data output stream that made testing, debugging, and all development on that stream easy; to quote my manager at the time, "Your RIO testing work rocks the hizouse"
                    \item Wrote the clock that replaced all calls to retrieve system time with a custom clock that allowed the developer to convince the whole system into thinking it was any arbitrary time so that time-based events and rules like market open, market close, and others to be simulated at any time, with a safeguard against it being used outside of local development and test environments
                    \item Introduced mock-object testing to a legacy project, complete with concrete, highly domain-relevant examples that allow other developers to easily follow suit with creating their own mock-based tests
