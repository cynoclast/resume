            % CX TMSLink ACT Reporting recon:
            \item Designed and delivered a scripting product based entirely on common UNIX utilities from requirements to production in one week that allowed automatic reconciliation of order execution data between disparate systems automatically, complete with emailed report generation in two days.
            % LiquiFiCore
            \item Demonstrated understanding of an unstated need and created an inbound-message validation framework that handles the job so cleanly that no feature has been requested of it since its inception. All existing validation was moved to it upon its release despite being unrequested.
            %Its acceptance has been demonstrated by how it was offered to other projects by management at the conclusion of its initial presentation.

            \item Introduced mock-object testing to a legacy project, complete with concrete, highly domain-relevant examples that allow other developers to easily follow suit with creating their own mock-based tests.
            \item Modified the above project to build using maven within the continuous integration server, Jenkins, complete with automated static code analysis tool implementation and unit test coverage measurement that provides fast build failure notification and QA.

            %\item I have created a Java program for adding colorful formatting to forum posts. Players of EVE Online may have seen it in action.
            %\item I enjoy *nix hacking greatly. The fun in quickly building something fast, powerful, and that does the job itself, all from a collection of simple tools is professionally satisfying.
            % \item *nix hacking. I have been tweaking the same bash profile for years. An apt metaphor is a wizard's staff. Without it, I am diminished in effectiveness within a shell. But, I can summon my staff to any \texttt{/home} in the world with nothing but an Internet connection and \texttt{svn}. Although, I will upgrade to \texttt{git} as soon as I can find someone to pay me to learn it.
            %\item Building and even choosing computers that suit serve their intended purpose.
            %\item Creating ebooks from text sources in the IDPF EPUB format for use in portable readers.
